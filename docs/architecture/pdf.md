🔍 Individual Model Breakdown
🔷 BLIP (Bootstrapped Language–Image Pretraining)
Models: Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base

Strengths: Simple, efficient, relatively lightweight.

Weaknesses: Can be generic or shallow for complex scenes.

📌 Best for lightweight captioning at scale (diagrams, basic photos, scanned docs).

🔷 BLIP-2
Models: Salesforce/blip2-flan-t5-xl, blip2-opt-2.7b, etc.

Strengths:

Combines a frozen vision encoder (CLIP or ViT) with a fused language model (T5 or OPT).

Captions are more fluent, descriptive, and context-aware.

Supports VQA-style prompts: "What does this chart show?"

📌 Best for high-quality captions + reasoning over images.

🔷 GIT (Generative Image-to-Text Transformer)
Models: microsoft/git-base, git-large

Strengths: Good accuracy on caption generation tasks.

Weaknesses:

Lacks reasoning or grounding.

Less active community than BLIP.

📌 Best for simple, one-shot captioning in documents or media.

🔷 LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant)
Models: llava-hf/llava-1.5-13b-hf

Strengths:

Built on Vicuna (or LLaMA) + CLIP vision encoders.

Can answer freeform questions about images, not just caption.

"Knows" how to explain what's in an image, even diagrams or instructions.

Weaknesses: Large, slow inference unless optimized.

📌 Best for conversational captioning or interactive reasoning (e.g., “What is this process flow?”).

🔷 Kosmos-2
Models: microsoft/kosmos-2-patch14-224

Strengths:

Supports image grounding: connects words to objects in the image.

Handles text in images (light OCR-like capabilities).

Unified architecture (no separate vision/text models).

Weaknesses: Less documentation and slower inference.

📌 Best for multi-modal documents with mixed image/text layouts.

| Fast captioning of simple images            | **BLIP**          | Lightweight, fast              |
| High-quality captioning for reasoning       | **BLIP-2**        | Superior language generation   |
| Captioning scanned docs/diagrams for search | **BLIP-2 + CLIP** | Pairs captions + embeddings    |
| VQA / image Q\&A                            | **LLaVA**         | Chat-style image analysis      |
| Image-text grounding / OCR-like input       | **Kosmos-2**      | Handles mixed-modality content |

Want a Recommendation?
If you're building a PDF-to-vector pipeline, I’d suggest:

BLIP-2 to generate descriptive captions of extracted images

Then use a text embedding model (like OpenAI or BGE) on those captions

Optionally use CLIP to embed the raw image too, for dual-mode search

# 🧠 PDF-to-Vector Ingest Pipeline

Extract **text and images** from PDFs, apply **OCR** and **captioning**, and generate **embeddings** for semantic search using a vector database.

---

## 📦 Overview

This pipeline supports multimodal ingestion of PDF documents by:

- Extracting structured **text**
- Pulling out **embedded images** (e.g. charts, diagrams)
- Running **OCR** on scanned images or pages
- Generating **captions** for images
- Creating and storing **text + image embeddings** for full-document searchability
